# ngCms

Dead simple CMS with angularJS and markdown.
Presentation is done with w3Css, but you can put whatever you want (feel free to customise index.html)


# How to use

Put the pages in /markdown. They will then be published at #/pagename.

# Design

Design can be completely changed in index.html
main.html defines how the article only is displayed.
